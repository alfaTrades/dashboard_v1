- Ability to use different technologies for each service
- Better fault isolation

**Disadvantages:**
- Increased operational complexity
- More complex data flow
- Potential performance overhead from service communication

**When to Consider:**
- For larger applications with multiple teams
- When different components have different scaling needs
- When planning for long-term evolution of the system

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture

**Structure:**
- **Event Bus**: Central message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- **Event Producers**: Data fetchers, user actions
- **Event Consumers**: Analysis engines, visualization generators
- **Query Services**: Provide data for UI display

**Advantages:**
- Real-time updates and processing
- Better handling of asynchronous operations
- Decoupling of components
- Good for streaming data analysis

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to implement and debug
- Requires additional infrastructure
- Potential for message delivery issues

**When to Consider:**
- For real-time trading applications
- When handling streaming financial data
- When building a system that needs to scale to many users

### 3. Serverless Architecture

**Structure:**
- **Cloud Functions**: For data processing and analysis
- **Static Frontend**: Hosted on CDN
- **Managed Services**: For data storage and authentication
- **API Gateway**: For function orchestration

**Advantages:**
- Minimal operational overhead
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Automatic scaling
- No server management required

**Disadvantages:**
- Potential cold start latency
- Vendor lock-in concerns
- Limitations on execution time
- Potentially higher costs at scale

**When to Consider:**
- For applications with variable usage patterns
- When minimizing operational costs is important
- For rapid development and deployment

## Alternative Data Storage Approaches

### 1. Time Series Database

**Options:**
- InfluxDB
- TimescaleDB
- Prometheus

**Advantages:**
- Optimized for time series data
- Efficient storage and querying
- Built-in aggregation functions
- Good for historical analysis

**When to Consider:**
- When working with large amounts of historical price data
- When performance of time-based queries is critical
- When data retention policies are important

### 2. Document Database

**Options:**

## Conclusion

While the chosen Python-only stack with Dash/Plotly provides an excellent balance of simplicity, power, and development speed for the Pairs Trading Dashboard, these alternative approaches offer different trade-offs that might be more suitable depending on specific requirements, team expertise, and long-term goals.

The best approach depends on factors such as:
- Scale of deployment
- Performance requirements
- Development team expertise
- Integration requirements
- Long-term maintenance considerations
- Budget constraints

For the current v1 implementation, the Python-only stack offers the most direct path to a functional dashboard while maintaining the flexibility to evolve toward any of these alternative approaches in the future.
